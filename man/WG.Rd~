\title{Weather generators for conditional simulation.}
\description{ 
Weather generators for conditional simulation of daily temperature
and/or precipitation, given mean and/or standard deviation. The family
of WG functions procude stochastic time series with similar
characteristics as the station series provided (if none if provided, it
will use either ferder or bjornholt provided by the esd-package). Here
characteristics means similar mean value, standard deviation, and
spectral properties. \code{FTscramble} takes the Fourier components
(doing a Fourier Transform - FT) of a series and reassigns random phase
to each frequency and then returns a new series through an inverse
FT. The FT scrambling is used for temperature, but not for precipitation
that is non-Gaussian and involves sporadic events with rain. For
precipitation, a different approach is used, taking the wet-day
frequency of each year and using the wet-day mean and ranomly generated
exponentially distributed numbers to provide similar aggregated annual
statistics as the station or predicted though downscaling. The
precipitation WG can also take into account the number of consequtive
number-of-dry-days statistics, using either a Poisson or a gemoetric
distribution.

\code{WG.FT.day.t2m} generates daily temperature from seasonal means and
standard deviations. It is given a sample station series, and uses
\code{FTscramble} to generate a series with random phase but similar (or
predicted - in the future) spectral characteristics. It then uses
interpolated mean values and quantile transform the results to prescribe
the predicted mean and standard deviation. The temperal structure is
imposed based on AR(1) - or other methods in the future (LPT). VERIFY!

\code{WG.fw.day.precip} uses the annual wet-day mean and the wet-day frequency
as input, and takes a sample station of daily values to simulate
number consequtive wet days based on the annual mean number of consequtive
wet days. m number generator giving exponentially distributed data. The
number of wet-days per year is taken to be normally distributed. The
daily amount is taken from stochastic values generated with
\code{\link{rexp}}. The number of consequtive wet days can be
approximated by a geometric distribution (\code{\link{rgeom}}). VERIFY!
